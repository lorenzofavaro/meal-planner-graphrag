    Create parallel Send messages to execute multiple queries concurrently.
    
    This function takes a ResearcherState containing multiple queries and creates
    a list of Send messages that will dispatch each query to the "execute_query"
    node for parallel execution. This enables concurrent processing of multiple
    database queries to improve performance.

        list[Send]: A list of Send messages, each configured to execute one query

                   individual query
